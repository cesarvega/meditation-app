# 🎵 Background Audio Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how the new background audio system works with beautiful track names and navigation controls.

## 🎶 Available Background Tracks

The following background audio tracks are now available in the meditation app:

1. **Celestial Whispers** - Gentle cosmic sounds with ethereal tones
2. **Cosmic Journey** - Expansive space-like ambient soundscape  
3. **Ethereal Waves** - Flowing, wave-like ambient textures
4. **Heavenly Breeze** - Light, airy atmospheric sounds
5. **Luminous Dreams** - Soft, dreamy ambient meditation music
6. **Peaceful Cosmos** - Calm cosmic atmosphere for deep meditation
7. **Serene Galaxy** - Tranquil space-inspired soundscape
8. **Starlight Meditation** - Gentle starlight-inspired ambient sounds
9. **Tranquil Skies** - Peaceful sky and air-inspired ambient music

## 🔧 How It Works

### AudioPlayerManager Updates
- Updated `backgroundTracks` array with new track names
- Added `displayBackgroundTrackName` computed property for UI-friendly names
- Added `formatTrackNameForDisplay()` function to convert filenames to readable names

### Navigation Controls
The background audio navigation is already implemented with:
- **Previous Button (⏮️)**: `playPreviousBackgroundTrack()` 
- **Next Button (⏭️)**: `playNextBackgroundTrack()`
- **Play/Pause Toggle**: Central button with track name display

### User Interface
- Track navigation buttons appear when multiple tracks are available
- Current track name is displayed below the background music toggle
- Names are automatically formatted (underscores become spaces, capitalized)

## 📱 User Experience

When users open the audio player:
1. They see the background music control section
2. If multiple tracks are available, navigation arrows appear
3. Tapping ⏮️ plays the previous track
4. Tapping ⏭️ plays the next track  
5. The current track name is displayed in a user-friendly format
6. Background music continues seamlessly while the main meditation plays
