// This file used to contain the App entrypoint.
// It was intentionally kept as a placeholder to avoid duplicate @main declarations
// after renaming to `MeditationApp.swift`. The real App struct now lives in
// `MeditationApp.swift` and this file is intentionally empty.

// If you want this file removed, delete it from the project in Xcode.
